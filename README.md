# password-manager
 <h2>PassManager is a simple password manager that stores and keep track of your login credentials.</h2>
 
It stores all the data inside a json file. It's an easy to send/sycn format.<br>
That's not the safest option and I will be working on upgrading it for a safer method.<br>
PassManager is a simple GUI app.
